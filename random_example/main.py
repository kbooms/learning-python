#library for random numbers
import random

for i in range(5):
    print(random.randint(1, 6))

# can also use "from" import statements
# e.g. from random import randint, randbytes, randrange
# doing this method allows the use of simply the function name without the {library}. notation
# book says using the dot-notation makes code more readable
